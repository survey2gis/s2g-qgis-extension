# survey2gis data processor

This QGIS extension is designed to streamline the workflow for archaeologists and survey technicians who capture measurement data in the field using total stations (tachymeters). It provides tools to normalize, process, and visualize these datasets within QGIS.

The extension:

- Normalizes raw data following predefined steps.
- Processes the optimized data using the open-source tool survey2gis, converting it into defined geometries in the shapefile format.
- Integrates processed geometries directly into QGIS for further analysis.

The survey2gis program is included as part of the extension for seamless integration.
